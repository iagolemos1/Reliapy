# Reliapy

Reliapy is a package/toolbox for python created in order to provide methods and tools in reliability, probability and statistics 
for engineers based on book [Probability, Reliability, and Statistical Methods in Engineering Design](https://www.wiley.com/en-sg/Probability%2C+Reliability%2C+and+Statistical+Methods+in+Engineering+Design-p-9780471331193), by S. Mahadevan and A. Haldar. 

The package/toolbox will follow the referenced book. It's in the beginning and there a lot of stuf to do! Every new thing will be available here :D
